Since there is no vaccine or quarantine, a large number of people get sick, and as the virus circulates, it reaches the people who were the first to get sick and no longer have immunity and re-infects them. This is how we get the second wave, as shown in the first three graphs. It should be noted that the number of people who have been infected since the first wave is growing - 250, 300, 350. It is the same with the second wave.\n",

    "1) Even a small change in the infectivity of the virus has a significant impact on the number of cases. At certain average infectivity values, the virus can receive new waves of infections even within a city of 500,000 people. At high infectivity, a larger outbreak occurs, which is not followed by subsequent waves.\n",
    "2) The vaccine matters, both in quantity and quality. For a vaccine with 80% effectiveness, we see that with ~70% of the population vaccinated, we get collective immunity. For a 60% effective vaccine, this number is closer to ~90%.\n",
    "3) Much depends on the graph model we choose. Moreover, a lot depends on the parameters of the graph. In particular, we were able to see an interesting dependence on the number of long-distance connections in people.\n",
    "4) Different quarantines have different effects, but obviously, you can't allow a large number of patients, otherwise you will have to introduce a very long quarantine to fix the situation. It is better to quarantine from the very beginning of the disease and increase its levels if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### So, it is possible to simulate a society using graphs. To do this, you need to choose the right graph structure that best suits your situation (this can be a small-world network). By realizing each node as a person, we can achieve plausible results, such as 70% of those vaccinated for collective immunity. Depending on the situation, you can add restrictions that will work, such as quarantine.их для колективного імунітету. В залежності від ситуації можна добавляти обмеження, які працюватимуть - наприклад, карантин."
